# Odin Recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project’s Foundations course. It’s a simple HTML-based website that showcases a collection of recipes.

## 🔧 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML structure and get comfortable with working on multi-page websites. The website includes:

- A main `index.html` homepage
- Individual recipe pages for each dish
- Navigation between pages using anchor tags

This project is focused purely on HTML — no CSS or JavaScript — to strengthen core concepts like semantic elements, links, lists, and boilerplate structure.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I’ve learned how to:

- Structure basic web pages using semantic HTML
- Use headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links
- Organize project files and maintain clean file paths
- Navigate and push code using Git and GitHub
- Start building a habit of writing clean, readable code
